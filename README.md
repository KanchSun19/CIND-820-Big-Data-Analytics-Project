The dataset used for this project:

Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set
It can be found on UCI Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29.


Description of Project:
My project will help to create a classifier that can help diagnose patients and predict the likelihood of a breast cancer.

Breast cancer is caused by the abnormal growth of cells in the breast tissue, which is known as a tumor. Tumors can be benign, pre-malignant, or malignant. Breast cancer is diagnosed using procedures such as MRI, mammography, ultrasound, and biopsy. The earlier the detection of breast cancer, the better the chance of survival. Most significantly, an early identification of breast cancer is crucial since it is linked to a greater number of treatment options, a higher chance of survival, and a better quality of life.
